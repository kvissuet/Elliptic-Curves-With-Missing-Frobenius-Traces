Serre's open image theorem may be stated as follows: for each number field $K$ and each elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K$, there is a constant $C_{E,K} > 0$ such that, for each prime $\ell \geq C_{E,K}$, we have $\rho_{E,\ell}(G_K) = \GL_2(\mbz/\ell\mbz)$.  Serre's uniformity question asks whether the constant $C_{E,K}$ above may be chosen independent of $E$, i.e. it asks whether, for each number field $K$ there exists a constant $C_K$ such that, for each elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K$ and for each prime $\ell \geq C_K$, we have $\rho_{E,\ell}(G_K) = \GL_2(\mbz/\ell\mbz)$.  In case $K = \mbq$, it is generally believed that Serre's uniformity question has an affirmative answer with $C_\mbq = 41$.  Furthermore, assuming that it does, then as a corollary of \cite[Lemma 4.10]{jonesconductorbound}, we may see that, for any non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over $\mbq$,
$
\ds \SL_2\text{-level}\left( \rho_E(G_\mbq) \right) \mid \prod_{\ell \leq C_\mbq} \ell^\infty.
$
This, taken together with Proposition \ref{twotothekproposition} implies that that
\begin{equation} \label{usefulbound}
G \in \mf{G}_{MT}^{\max} \; \Longrightarrow \; \GL_2\text{-level}\left( G \right) \mid \prod_{\ell \leq C_\mbq} \ell^\infty,
\end{equation}
Recent work establishes vertical bounds on the largest possible $n$ for which $\ell^n$ divides $m_G$ when $G = \rho_{E}(G_\mbq)$ when $\ell = 2$ (see \cite{rousedzb}) and it is of general interest to establish such vertical bounds for all $\ell$; clearly such bounds are relevant to the problem of determining the set $\mf{G}_{MT}^{\max}$, even conditionally on an affirmative answer to Serre's uniformity question.  In any event, together with the tables of Cummins-Pauli, \eqref{usefulbound} reduces the determination of $\mf{G}_{MT}^{\max}(g)$ to a targeted computer search, for any fixed genus $g$.
It would be interesting to extend the results in the present paper to $g = 1$, in the spirit of Sutherland-Zywina, to find all modular curves (or Weierstrass models in case $-I \notin G$) that have infinitely many rational points.  We leave this to future work.
